# HealersMate

HealersMate is a unit frames addon for World of Warcraft Vanilla 1.12 tailored for healers, striving to be an alternative to modern WoW's VuhDo, Cell, or Healbot.

### Not Just For Healers

While HealersMate is made with a healers-first mentality, it can be a viable option for raid frames for non-healers or dispellers.

### Still In Development

Currently, 2.0.0 is in Alpha, which means there may be bugs and there are certain features lacking. Namely, a way to customize the UI. Under the hood, a lot of things are in place, but a user-friendly configuration is in the works. If you're feeling bold and know how to mess around with Lua, you can edit Profile.lua and ProfileManager.lua to finely customize your UI or define your own scripts under Customize>Advanced Options. See [this wiki page](https://github.com/i2ichardt/HealersMate/wiki/Load-Script) for more info.

### Client Mods That Enhance HealersMate

While not required, the mods listed below will massively improve your experience with HealersMate, and likely the game in general. Note that some vanilla servers may not allow these mods and you should check with your server to see if they do. Turtle WoW does not seem to have a problem with any of these. See [this page](https://github.com/RetroCro/TurtleWoW-Mods) for information about how to install mods.

| Mod | Enhancement |
| - | - |
| SuperWoW ([GitHub](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW)) | - Shows more accurate incoming healing, and shows incoming healing from players that do not have HealComm<br>- Track the remaining duration of many buffs and HoTs on other players<br>- Allows casting on players without doing split-second target switching<br>- Lets you see accurate distance to friendly players/NPCs<br>- Lets you set units you're hovering over as your mouseover target |
| UnitXP SP3 ([GitHub](https://github.com/allfoxwy/UnitXP_SP3)) | Allows HealersMate to show very accurate distance to both friendly players and enemies, and show if they're out of line-of-sight |
| Nampower ([Pepopo's Fork](https://github.com/pepopo978/nampower) - Recommended / [Original](https://github.com/namreeb/nampower)) | Drastically decreases the amount of time in between casting consecutive spells  |

| Question/Issue | Answer |
| - | - |
| **I can't see any buffs or HoTs on players** | If you're using a non-English WoW client, they are currently not supported by HealersMate. See these issues for more information: https://github.com/i2ichardt/HealersMate/issues/22 https://github.com/i2ichardt/HealersMate/issues/24 |
| **Casting on other players doesn't work** | If you are using the CallOfElements addon, there is an issue with that addon that prevents HealersMate from casting properly. To fix it, install [this version of CallOfElements](https://github.com/laytya/CallOfElements). |
| **How can I make health bars be class colored?** | Customizable frames are still in development. That said, if you'd like class-colored bars now, it is possible to edit the load script to make it happen. See [this wiki page](https://github.com/i2ichardt/HealersMate/wiki/Load-Script#class-colored-health-bars). |
| **Can I use mouseover macros?** | Currently, the SuperWoW mod is required to be able to use mouseover macros with HealersMate. This requirement will be lifted in a future update. |
